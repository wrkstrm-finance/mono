## Summary

Fixed CodeSwiftly DocC preview routing by removing the baseUrl override for
/documentation/<slug> previews so SPA navigation and assets resolve correctly.

## Highlights

- Confirmed JSON endpoints were healthy while the SPA router returned “page not found.”
- Kept DocC’s baseUrl at "/" for documentation previews to match the archive output.
- Rebuilt and reinstalled the CodeSwiftly mac app for validation.

## Paths Touched

- `code/mono/apple/spm/cross/WrkstrmDocCPreviewCore/Sources/WrkstrmDocCPreviewCore/DocCPreviewService.swift`
