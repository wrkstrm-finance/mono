## Summary

Expanded the roundup-report CLI to produce executive product roundups with coverage metrics,
release cadence, audits, and owned-library filtering. Regenerated Tau, Hack-Nu, and CodeSwiftly
DocC bundles with grouped day events and source file listings, while excluding build artifacts.

## Highlights

- Added data coverage and next-step callouts in roundup pages.
- Added git tag cadence capture and audit checks for missing pages and broken links.
- Filtered sources and git events to skip .build/derived outputs and scoped libraries to owned
  packages and targets.

## Paths Touched

- `.clia/agents/tau/spm/launchpad/scratchpad/tau-report/Sources/RoundupReportCLI/RoundupReportCLI.swift`
- `code/mono/docc/roundups/tau/tau-2025-roundup.docc`
- `code/mono/docc/roundups/hack-nu/hack-nu-2025-roundup.docc`
- `code/mono/docc/roundups/code-swiftly/code-swiftly-2025-roundup.docc`
