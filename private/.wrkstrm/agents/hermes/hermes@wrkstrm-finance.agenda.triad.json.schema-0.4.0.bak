        "Adopt the wrkstrm DocC design system for swift-tradier-lib: add a real DocC bundle with minimum layout (index@TechnologyRoot + overview/motivation/design/architecture/implementation/getting-started).",
        "Curate DocC navigation via Topics containers (avoid double-curation): root links to guides/reference/tutorials containers; containers own leaf pages.",
        "Add a canonical Getting Started that proves a happy-path: obtain token (sandbox/prod), initialize service, fetch quote, expected output, next steps.",
        "Upgrade TradierCLI into a docs-grade sanity check tool: flags for --env/--symbol/--account-id, support --json output, consistent exit codes, avoid hard-coded AAPL/account.",
        "Replace fatalError paths in public-ish bridging (e.g., missing managed context / unsupported type selection) with typed, documented errors; reflect failure modes in implementation docs.",
        "Document and/or remove the default sandbox token behavior; clearly label as dev-only if retained.",
        "Add CI badge links for build/test/doc coverage to README.",
        "Document SPM_USE_LOCAL_DEPS behavior in README and workflows.",
        "Expand DocC with request/response examples for each service (and map Tradier→CommonBroker adapters in a reference table)."
